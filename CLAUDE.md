# Notes for working on EPDF

EPDF is one of the AERA Atari apps (ECal, EContact, EMail, EFTP, EHypView, ClaudeST). They are meant to
look and behave as one family.

## For every AERA app

These come from AERA-Atari's repo template and are the same in every app's CLAUDE.md.

- **Follow the AERA Atari app guidelines** ([ATARI-APP-GUIDELINES.md](https://github.com/whomper/AERA-Atari/blob/main/standards/ATARI-APP-GUIDELINES.md)). Pay most
  attention to:
  - About box
  - family shortcuts
  - PRG/ACC rules
  - context menus
  - VA_START, help, alerts
  - INF location

  When a change touches one of these, do it the guideline's way, even if the old code here did it
  differently.
- **Speed is set by the stock machines** (Erez, 26 Oct 2026; the guidelines' "Speed"): an 8 MHz ST
  and a stock Falcon (`ST`, `ST-1`, `Falcon-4`), not the DFB1. Design and code for them: draw only
  what changed, keep the 68000's slow operations out of inner loops, do work once. A change to
  drawing, a loop over the data or the start gives its `AESGAP` stretches on `ST` and `Falcon-4`,
  before and after, in its commit message. A GEM release passes the speed rig within the
  guidelines' times.
- **Shared code lives in [AERA-Atari](https://github.com/whomper/AERA-Atari).** Files under `common/` come from it. Change them
  there, not here, and pull them in with `tools/sync-common.sh`. A fix made only in this repo will drift
  again.
- **Build and test before every push:** `make` with no warnings and `make test`, plus this repo's
  own checks (below): `make itest` when network code changed, the Hatari rigs in `tests/hatari/` when
  the GEM side changed.
- **Versions and releases:** `VERSION` changes only in a release commit. A release: `tools/bump.py`,
  commit, push, then run the Release workflow on `main` with the notes (or push a tag `vX.Y` made with
  `git tag -a`); it tests, builds, tags vX.Y and publishes each file and the zip as a GitHub Release.
  A build must leave every tracked file unchanged and shows the version in `VERSION` as it is (there is
  no `-dev` label). Don't
  commit built programs, help files or certificates (`binary/`, `dist/`). Never reuse a number.
- **Only formal releases leave the build machine.** Erez gets vX.Y releases made by the Release workflow from
  `main`, nothing else: no test builds, no CI artifacts, no builds from a branch.
  Work lands on `main`; to try a fix on real hardware, release it. If a release doesn't work, roll back
  with a release: revert on `main`, release the next number, and run the Withdraw workflow
  (`.github/workflows/withdraw.yml`) on the bad one: it puts "Withdrawn: use vX.Y" at the top of its notes.
- **Releases go out without asking Erez** (his decision, 23 Oct 2026; guidelines 1.2). Release when
  work on `main` is ready:
  - this repo's checks pass;
  - the rigs on his TOS pass, where this file asks for them;
  - the hub's family checks pass.

  Then give Erez the link in one line, with anything he has to do, and send the hub the link. Roll
  back a bad release the same way. Decisions that are his (design, Pi packages, ports, a change to
  what a user sees that wasn't asked for) still go to him first.
- **Testing with another AERA program uses its latest release**, what Erez runs, never a build of its
  `main`: `common/tools/getrelease.py APP DIR FILE...` fetches it. Only for a change both programs are
  still making, test against the other's `main` at a named commit, say so, and test again against its
  release when it is out.
- **Every new source file starts with the SPDX line and copyright** (see any `.c` file); a generator
  writes them into the files it makes.
- **The name** reads "AERA | Erez Yaary" wherever it is given: copyright lines
  (`Copyright (C) 2026 AERA | Erez Yaary`), the About box, the help file's `@author`, the docs, and as
  the author of every commit: `git commit --author="AERA | Erez Yaary <yaary@me.com>"`, with Claude as
  the signing committer, so GitHub shows the commits as Verified (AERA-Atari,
  `standards/GITHUB-IDENTITY.md`).
- **Never commit:**
  - real addresses from the owner's network: use `192.168.1.x`, `PI_IP`, `ATARI_IP`
  - passwords, session keys, `.KEY` / `.INF` files from a test run
  - photos that still carry EXIF/GPS data
- **README:** keep the section order from the template (Highlights, Getting started, How it reaches the
  servers, Building, Source, Tests, Licence, family footer). Use British English.

## EPDF

What is particular to this repo: its exact test commands, its gateway, its memory limits, the code it
shares with a sibling app.
